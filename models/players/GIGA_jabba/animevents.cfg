//
// STRUCTURE:
//
// SOUND format: animID AEV_SOUND framenum soundpath randomlow randomhi chancetoplay
// animID = Animation enum/name
// AEV_SOUND = tells game which type of event it is (so it knows what to do with the following data)
// framenum = Frame into sequence where event should start
// soundpath = path to the sound to play (%d means the next 2 numbers are the random range - for example if you want to play laser1, laser2 or laser3, use "laser%d 1 3")
// randomlow = low number for sound variant (if no variant, use 0)
// randomhi = high number for sound variant (if no variant, use 0)
// chancetoplay = probability event will play (0 = always, 1-99 is percentage of chance to play)
//
// FOOTSTEP format: animID AEV_FOOTSTEP framenum footstepType chancetoplay
// animID = Animation enum/name
// AEV_FOOTSTEP = tells game which type of event it is (so it knows what to do with the following data)
// framenum = Frame into sequence where event should start
// footstepType = FOOTSTEP_R, FOOTSTEP_L, FOOTSTEP_HEAVY_R or FOOTSTEP_HEAVY_L
// chancetoplay = probability event will play (0 = always, 1-99 is percentage of chance to play)
//
// EFFECT format: animID AEV_EFFECT framenum effectpath boltName chancetoplay
// animID = Animation enum/name
// AEV_EFFECT = tells game which type of event it is (so it knows what to do with the following data)
// framenum = Frame into sequence where event should start
// effectpath = path to the .efx file you want to play - if you put "special" it will play the hard-coded in-engine effect specified in the next field (usually boltName)
// boltName = bolt (if any) to play the effect on.  If none use "none" or "NULL" - if you put "special" in the effectpath, this is the name of the hard-coded in-engine effect to do and the next field is how many milliseconds to do it for
// chancetoplay = probability event will play (0 = always, 1-99 is percentage of chance to play) - if you put "special" in the effectpath, this is how many milliseconds to do the hard-coded in-engine effect for
//
// FIRE format: animID AEV_FIRE framenum altfire chancetofire
// animID = Animation enum/name
// AEV_FIRE = tells game which type of event it is (so it knows what to do with the following data)
// framenum = Frame into sequence where event should start
// altfire = 0 if normal fire, 1 if alt-fire
// chancetoplay = probability event will play (0 = always, 1-99 is percentage of chance to play)
//
// MOVE format: animID AEV_MOVE framenum forwardpush rightpush uppush
// animID = Animation enum/name
// AEV_MOVE = tells game which type of event it is (so it knows what to do with the following data)
// framenum = Frame into sequence where event should start
// forwardpush = amount to push forward ( < 0 is backwards )
// rightpush = amount to push right ( < 0 is left )
// uppush = amount to push up ( < 0 is down )
